								<h3> Software Engineering for Research Software Development</h3> 
									<p class="info">Researchers in a number of scientific,  engineering,  business,  and humanities domains increasingly develop and/or use software to conduct or support their research.  We refer to this software collectively as research software.   Research in this domain, whether numerical relativity, weather forecasting, high-energy physics or cancer research, needs to support our worldâ€™s critical needs. As a result, scientists and engineers are devoting increasingly larger portions of their research effort to software development where it is important that they have proper software engineering practices. If the software is of poor quality, then the results are less trustworthy or prone to failure in mission-critical situations. In addition, gaining scientific insights and predicting natural phenomena clearly require trustworthy results. Regarding this impact, my research focuses on developing techniques and tools to assist developers in efficiently building high-quality software.</p>
